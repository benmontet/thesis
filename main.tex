\begin{acknowledgements} 	 
I am extremely grateful to everyone who has helped me get to Caltech, as well as those
who have helped me through these past five years.
Of course, this list must begin with my parents: thank you for all your support and
encouragement over the past 27 years.
I also want to thank my fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Kim Klappauf, for always being so
enthusiastic and showing us that being into science was cool.
I want to thank my advisor, John Johnson, and everyone involved in the Exolab during 
my time. 
That (long!) list includes Justin Crepp, Phil Muirhead, Leslie Rogers,
Brendan Bowler, Jennifer Yee, and Luan Ghezzi for allowing them to regularly bug them with
questions in their offices.
I especially want to thank Jon Swift for his patience in working through problems on the
white board, his pedantry in third order corrections, and his enthusiasm for life both
inside and out of Cahill.

I want to thank everyone involved with the Summer 2013 ``Modern Statistical and
Computational Methods for Analysis of Kepler Data'' workshop at the Statistical and
Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
The workshop certainly changed the trajectory of my thesis, and allowed me to meet 
new friends and collaborators. 
I thank the organizers, especially Eric Ford and David Hogg (the latter whom, I
acknowledge formally,
I still owe a bottle of good wine), for allowing me to participate, and the participants
for being so amazing, especially Ruth, Dan, Robert, Megan, Ben, Angie, and Gal.

I want to thank the Caltech Astronomy graduate students for being the friendliest, 
most pleasant classmates and friends one could ask for. 
I particularly want to thank (in no particular order) Mislav, Antonija, Trevor, Allison, Yi, Matt, Sirio,
Gwen, Drew, and Ryan. 
To my officemates Walter, Shriharsh, Drew, Sirio, and Mislav: thank you for putting up
with me. Sorry I took away your couch (if it's any consolation, it looks nice in my 
apartment.)
I also want to thank the faculty for allowing the graduate community to be what it is, 
especially Wal Sargent. I still miss seeing your face around the department and hearing
your opinions on everything from iced tea to camping. And football, especially football.

I will always remember the traditions shared among the Cahill grad students: 
ski trips to Mammoth (never Big Bear, sorry Trevor), Wednesday night softball with the Big Bangers,
Halloween parties, trips to the Athenaeum, wine and cheese, concerts at the Hollywood
Bowl, finding space for 15 people to eat lunch together at Chandler, and so much more.

I would like to thank my committee: Heather Knutson, Gregg Hallinan, Phil Hopkins, and
Tony Readhead for reading my thesis (at least this far) and for their support and
guidance.
I also want to thank Patrick Shopbell, Anu Mahabal, and Jos\'e Calderon, who must form
the best computing staff in all of astronomy.

Finally, I want to thank Laura. Thank you for your support. 
Thank you for always being there when I need someone.
Thank you for always being there when I need someone to put me in my place.
I've enjoyed every day of our adventure, and I can't wait to see what happens next.

\begin{abstract}
In this thesis, I present seven studies aimed towards better understanding the demographics
and physical properties of M dwarfs and their companions.
These studies focus in turn on planetary, brown dwarf, and stellar companions to M dwarfs.

I begin with an analysis of radial velocity and transit timing analyses of multi-transiting
planetary systems, finding that if both signals are measured to sufficiently high precision
the stellar and planetary masses can be measured to a high precision, eliminating a need
for stellar models which may have systematic errors.
I then combine long-term radial velocity monitoring and a direct imaging
campaign to measure the occurrence rate of giant planets around M dwarfs.
I find that $6.5\% \pm 3.0\%$ of M dwarfs host a Jupiter mass or larger planet within
20 AU, with a strong dependence on stellar metallicity.

I then present two papers analyzing the LHS\,6343 system, which contains a widely
separated M dwarf binary (AB).
Star A hosts a transiting brown dwarf (LHS\,6343\,C) with a 12.7 day period.
By combining radial velocity data with transit photometry, I am able to measure
the mass and radius of the brown dwarf to 2\% precision, the most precise measurement
of a brown dwarf to date.
I then analyze four secondary eclipses of the LHS\,6343\,AC system as observed by \spitz\
in order to measure the luminosity of the brown dwarf in both \spitz\ bandpasses.
I find the brown dwarf is consistent with theoretical models of an 1100 K T dwarf at an
age of 5 Gyr and empirical observations of field T5-6 dwarfs with temperatures of 
$1070 \pm 130$ K.
This is the first non-inflated brown dwarf with a measured mass, radius, and multi-band
photometry, making it an ideal test of evolutionary models of field brown dwarfs.

Next, I present the results of an astrometric and radial velocity campaign to measure the
orbit and masses of both stars in the GJ\,3305\,AB system, an M+M binary comoving with
51\,Eridani, a more massive star with a directly imaged planetary companion.
I compare the masses of both stars to largely untested theoretical models of young M 
dwarfs, finding that the models are consistent with the measured mass of star A but 
slightly overpredict the luminosity of star B.

In the final two science chapters I focus on space-based transit surveys, present and
future.
First, I present the first catalog of statistically validated planets from the \KT\ mission, as well as updated stellar and planetary parameters for all systems with candidate
planets in the first \KT\ field.
The catalog includes K2-18b, a ``mini-Neptune'' planet that receives a stellar insolation
consistent with the level that the Earth receives from the Sun, making it a useful
comparison against planets of a similar size that are highly irradiated, such as GJ\,1214\,b.
Finally, I present predictions for the \textit{WFIRST} mission. 
While designed largely as a microlensing mission, I find it will be able to detect
as many as 30,000 transiting planets towards the galactic bulge, providing
information about how planet occurrence changes across the galaxy.
These planets will be able to be confirmed largely through direct detection of their
secondary eclipses.
Moreover, I find that more than 50\% of the planets it detects smaller than Neptune 
will be found around M dwarf hosts.

\chapter{Model-independent Stellar and Planetary Masses from Multi-transiting Exoplanetary Systems}
\label{chap:ttvs}

In this chapter I develop a method to measure the masses of planets and their host stars
without any reliance on stellar models by combining information from RVs and TTVs. 
This chapter was originally published as ``Model-independent Stellar and Planetary Masses from Multi-transiting Exoplanetary Systems,'' ApJ, 762, 112 (2013) by BTM and 
John Johnson. This work was inspired by the July, 2012 Sagan Workshop on ``Working with
Exoplanet Light Curves'' held on Caltech's campus.
There have been considerable advances in stellar models and
empirical relations to characterize low-mass stars over the past five years.
Still,
the large number of TTV systems that will be discovered by current and future transit
missions combined with advances in precision RV spectroscopy leave this method as a viable
possibility in order to characterize stars that are not well-explained by stellar models.
