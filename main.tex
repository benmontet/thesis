\begin{abstract}
In this thesis, I present seven studies aimed towards better understanding the demographics
and physical properties of M dwarfs and their companions.
These studies focus in turn on planetary, brown dwarf, and stellar companions to M dwarfs.

I begin with an analysis of radial velocity and transit timing analyses of multi-transiting
planetary systems, finding that if both signals are measured to sufficiently high precision
the stellar and planetary masses can be measured to a high precision, eliminating a need
for stellar models which may have systematic errors.
I then combine long-term radial velocity monitoring and a direct imaging
campaign to measure the occurrence rate of giant planets around M dwarfs.
I find that $6.5\% \pm 3.0\%$ of M dwarfs host a Jupiter mass or larger planet within
20 AU, with a strong dependence on stellar metallicity.

I then present two papers analyzing the LHS\,6343 system, which contains a widely
separated M dwarf binary (AB).
Star A hosts a transiting brown dwarf (LHS\,6343\,C) with a 12.7 day period.
By combining radial velocity data with transit photometry, I am able to measure
the mass and radius of the brown dwarf to 2\% precision, the most precise measurement
of a brown dwarf to date.
I then analyze four secondary eclipses of the LHS\,6343\,AC system as observed by \spitz\
in order to measure the luminosity of the brown dwarf in both \spitz\ bandpasses.
I find the brown dwarf is consistent with theoretical models of an 1100 K T dwarf at an
age of 5 Gyr and empirical observations of field T5-6 dwarfs with temperatures of 
$1070 \pm 130$ K.
This is the first non-inflated brown dwarf with a measured mass, radius, and multi-band
photometry, making it an ideal test of evolutionary models of field brown dwarfs.

Next, I present the results of an astrometric and radial velocity campaign to measure the
orbit and masses of both stars in the GJ\,3305\,AB system, an M+M binary comoving with
51\,Eridani, a more massive star with a directly imaged planetary companion.
I compare the masses of both stars to largely untested theoretical models of young M 
dwarfs, finding that the models are consistent with the measured mass of star A but 
slightly overpredict the luminosity of star B.

In the final two science chapters I focus on space-based transit surveys, present and
future.
First, I present the first catalog of statistically validated planets from the \KT\ mission, as well as updated stellar and planetary parameters for all systems with candidate
planets in the first \KT\ field.
The catalog includes K2-18b, a ``mini-Neptune'' planet that receives a stellar insolation
consistent with the level that the Earth receives from the Sun, making it a useful
comparison against planets of a similar size that are highly irradiated, such as GJ\,1214\,b.
Finally, I present predictions for the \textit{WFIRST} mission. 
While designed largely as a microlensing mission, I find it will be able to detect
as many as 30,000 transiting planets towards the galactic bulge, providing
information about how planet occurrence changes across the galaxy.
These planets will be able to be confirmed largely through direct detection of their
secondary eclipses.
Moreover, I find that more than 50\% of the planets it detects smaller than Neptune 
will be found around M dwarf hosts.

\chapter{Model-independent Stellar and Planetary Masses from Multi-transiting Exoplanetary Systems}
\label{chap:ttvs}

In this chapter I develop a method to measure the masses of planets and their host stars
without any reliance on stellar models by combining information from RVs and TTVs. 
This chapter was originally published as ``Model-independent Stellar and Planetary Masses from Multi-transiting Exoplanetary Systems,'' ApJ, 762, 112 (2013) by BTM and 
John Johnson. This work was inspired by the July, 2012 Sagan Workshop on ``Working with
Exoplanet Light Curves'' held on Caltech's campus.
There have been considerable advances in stellar models and
empirical relations to characterize low-mass stars over the past five years.
Still,
the large number of TTV systems that will be discovered by current and future transit
missions combined with advances in precision RV spectroscopy leave this method as a viable
possibility in order to characterize stars that are not well-explained by stellar models.

\chapter{The Occurrence Rate of Giant Planets around M Dwarfs}
\label{chap:trends}

In this chapter I develop a method to determine the occurrence
rate of giant planets in wide orbits around their host stars.
These planets are large enough to cause a slow drift, or trend, in 
the RV of their host star, but too distant from their star to
observe the full orbit on a reasonable timescale.
Such a trend could be caused by a planet, or a star on a much
wider orbit. As stars would be easily observable with high-contrast
direct imaging, the existence of a trend combined with an AO 
non-detection suggests the presence of a planet is likely.
The definitive presence of any single planet can not be 
determined, but by analyzing a population of these systems their
bulk occurrence can be measured.
This chapter was originally published as ``The TRENDS High-contrast Imaging Survey. IV. The Occurrence Rate of Giant Planets around M Dwarfs,'' ApJ, 781, 28 (2014) by BTM, Justin Crepp, John Johnson,
Andrew Howard, and Geoff Marcy.

\chapter{Physical Properties of the Transiting Brown Dwarf LHS\,6343\,C}
\label{chap:lhs1}


In this chapter I focus on LHS\,6343\,C, a brown dwarf transiting one member of an M+M binary in the \kep\ field.
Given the relative brightness of the host star and the high signal-to-noise ratio on the individual transits themselves,
analyzing this system was a test of the limits of \kep\ data: given a sufficiently high signal transit, what limits our precision?
Are there any assumptions we often make, such as details of limb darkening, that will eventually break down? 
Are there any robust methods to characterize the star without relying on the fine details of any particular set of stellar models?
This chapter was originally published as ``Characterizing the Cool KOIs. VII. Refined Physical Properties of the Transiting Brown Dwarf LHS\,6343\,C,'' ApJ, 800, 134 (2015) by BTM, John Johnson, Phil Moorhead, Ashley Villar, Corinne Vassallo,
Cristoph Baranec, Nick Law, Reed Riddle, Geoff Marcy, Andrew Howard, and Howard Isaacson.

\chapter{Spitzer Secondary Eclipse Observations of LHS\,6343\,C Yield Brightness Temperature and mid-T Spectral Class}

\label{chap:lhsspitz}
In this chapter I continue the discussion of LHS\,6343\,C.
Given the precise mass and radius measured in the previous chapter, we considered what observations would be necessary
to compare this object to the field brown dwarfs with well-characterized atmospheres but no direct measurements of
their masses and radii.
We concluded the best opportunity to measure the atmosphere of the brown dwarf would be through secondary eclipses
observations of the system as observed with \spitz, leading to a successful Cycle-10 proposal to observe four eclipses, 
two in each \spitz\ bandpass.
In this chapter I analyze these data and compare them to both theoretical models of brown dwarfs and empirical observations
of field brown dwarfs.
This chapter was originally published as ``Benchmark Transiting Brown Dwarf LHS\,6343\,C: Spitzer Secondary Eclipse Observations Yield Brightness Temperature and mid-T Spectral Class,'' ApJL, 822, 6 (2016) by BTM, John Johnson,
Jonathan Fortney, and Jean-Michel Desert.

\chapter{Masses and Orbital Parameters of GJ\,3305\,AB, the Wide Binary Companion to the Imaged Exoplanet Host 51\,Eri}
\label{chap:Mbinaries}

In this chapter I continue comparing observations of low-mass stars to predictions from theoretical models.
Throughout my graduate studies I have led a long-term program to measure masses of M dwarfs in young moving groups
through astrometric and RV observations of their orbits using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) at the 
Discovery Channel Telescope and Gemini Observatory and the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph at 
Mt. Hopkins.
As we must observe a substantial fraction of the orbit before we can determine a unique mass, this is a long-term project
not intended to be completed during this thesis.
As a part of this thesis, we published the first results from this survey, outlining our methods and presenting the first binary
system with a closed orbit, the GJ\,3305\,AB binary.
This chapter was originally published as ``Dynamical Masses of Young M Dwarfs: Masses and Orbital Parameters of GJ 3305 AB, the Wide Binary Companion to the Imaged Exoplanet Host 51 Eri,'' ApJL, 813, 11 (2015) by BTM, Brendan Bowler, 
Evgenya Shkolnik, Katherine Deck, Ji Wang, Elliott Horch, Michael Liu, Lynne Hillenbrand, Adam Kraus, and Dave 
Charbonneau.

\chapter{Stellar and Planetary Properties of \KT\ Campaign~1 Candidates and Validation of 17 Planets, Including a Planet Receiving Earth-like Insolation}
\label{chap:k2}
In the final two science chapters I turn my attention to large surveys. The first of these is \KT\ the extended \kep\ mission.
The large systematics inherent to \KT\ data make detecting planets more challenging than in \kep; the stellar target list is
put together only months before each field as a conglomeration of many other catalogs, making stellar parameters uncertain
and potentially systematically biased.
Here, we attempt to solve both of these issues.
Following a systematic search for transiting planets, we combine RV data, AO imaging, and archival data on the stars to
better infer stellar parameters and statistically validate the transiting planets, applying our methods to Campaign 1 of the
\KT\ mission.
We validate 17 planets, including one which receives an Earth-like level of insolation and has an equilibrium temperature of $272 \pm 15$ K.
This chapter was originally published as ``Stellar and Planetary Properties of K2 Campaign 1 Candidates and Validation of 17 Planets, Including a Planet Receiving Earth-like Insolation,'' ApJ, 809, 25 (2015) by BTM, Tim Morton, Dan Foreman-Mackey,
John Johnson, David Hogg, Brendan Bowler, Dave Latham, Allyson Bieryla, and Andrew Mann.

\input{chapter7/ms.tex}

\chapter{Measuring the Galactic Distribution of Transiting Systems with \WF}
\label{chap:wfirst}
Finally, I consider the possibility of \WF\ to act as a transit search mission.
Designed to search for signals of planets gravitationally microlensing more distant stars, the survey
requires high precision observations of millions of stars at a 15-minute cadence, ideal to detect
transiting planets.
I explore what kinds of planets we would hope to detect from this mission, finding that it could discover more than 30,000
transiting planets, largely hot Jupiters.
I then consider what observations would be required to confirm or validate these planets, finding that the small planets
will be most easily detectable when they are in dynamically interacting multiple-planet systems through the detection of
TTVs.
Giant planets, on the other hand, will be able to be confirmed through direct detection of their secondary eclipses.
This chapter will be submitted to the Astrophysical Journal as ``Measuring the Galactic Distribution of Planets with \WF'' by
BTM, Jennifer Yee, and Matthew Penny.
